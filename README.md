## ðŸ’¥ Docker

The container files are in [./docker](./docker) and the associated scripts in [./docker-bin](./docker-bin).
When a script is called and the container does not exist, it is automatically built.

Containers can be created and deleted manually:

- dotfiles-docker-build-\<container name\> (e.g. `dotfiles-docker-build-latex`)
- dotfiles-docker-rm-\<container name\> (e.g. `dotfiles-docker-rm-latex`)

You can also create or delete all containers at once:

- dotfiles-docker-all-build
- dotfiles-docker-all-rm

#### Containers (with scripts)

- **LaTeX** - a container with texlive.
  - pdflatex
  - xelatex
- **Pandoc** - a container with pandox.
  - pandoc
  - pandoc-pdf (uses the LaTeX container)

#### Script: pandoc-pdf

Create a german DIN 676 letter from a markdown file.
The LaTeX template for the letter is located at [pandoc/templates/letter.latex](pandoc/templates/letter.latex).

In folder [example/pandoc-pdf](example/pandoc-pdf) is an example.
The script `pandoc-pdf letter.md` must be called in this folder.
