## ðŸ’¥ Docker

The container files are in [./docker](./docker) and the associated scripts in [./docker-bin](./docker-bin).
When a script is called and the container does not exist, it is automatically built.

Containers can be created and deleted manually:

- dotfiles-docker-build-\<container name\> (e.g. `dotfiles-docker-build-latex`)
- dotfiles-docker-rm-\<container name\> (e.g. `dotfiles-docker-rm-latex`)

You can also create or delete all containers at once:

- dotfiles-docker-all-build
- dotfiles-docker-all-rm

### Containers (with scripts)

- **hadolint** - a Dockerfile linter
  - `hadolint`
- **LaTeX** - a container with texlive.
  - `pdflatex`
  - `xelatex`
- **Pandoc** - a container with pandoc.
  - `pandoc`
  - `pandoc-pdf` (uses the LaTeX container)
  - `pandoc-letter` (uses the LaTeX container)

### Script: pandoc-letter

Create a german DIN 676 letter from a markdown file.
The LaTeX template for the letter is located at [pandoc/templates/letter.latex](pandoc/templates/letter.latex).

In folder [example/pandoc-pdf](example/pandoc-pdf) is an example.
The script `pandoc-letter letter.md` must be called in this folder.

### Script: pandoc-pdf

Converts a Markdown file to a PDF file.
The template [Eisvogel](https://github.com/Wandmalfarbe/pandoc-latex-template) is used.
