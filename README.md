## ðŸ’¥ Docker

The container files are in [./docker](./docker) and the associated scripts in [./docker-bin](./docker-bin).
When a script is called and the container does not exist, it is automatically built.

Containers can be created and deleted manually:

- dotfiles-docker-build-\<container name\> (e.g. `dotfiles-docker-build-latex`)
- dotfiles-docker-rm-\<container name\> (e.g. `dotfiles-docker-rm-latex`)

You can also create or delete all containers at once:

- dotfiles-docker-all-build
- dotfiles-docker-all-rm

#### Containers (with scripts)

- **latex** - a container with texlive. The following scripts are available:
  - pdflatex
  - xelatex
