## dotfiles

All static dotfiles are stored in the [configs](./configs) folder. Via `./setup install` or `./setup update` the files are linked to the home directory. The folder structure of configs is kept in the home directory.

## scripts

List of all scripts in [bin](./bin)

- **sleeps** - sleeps is an extension of **sleep** with a visual representation of the waiting time

## docker

List of all container in [docker](./docker) and scripts in [docker-bin](./docker-bin).
When a script is called and the container does not exist, it is automatically built.

Containers can be created and deleted manually:
- dotfiles-docker-build-<container name> (e.g. dotfiles-docker-build-latex)
- dotfiles-docker-rm-<container name> (e.g. dotfiles-docker-rm-latex)

You can also create or delete all containers at once:
- dotfiles-docker-all-build
- dotfiles-docker-all-rm

### Container with scripts

- **latex** - a container with texlive. The following scripts are available:
  - pdflatex
  - xelatex
